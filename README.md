# What is Chainsaw-OCR?
Chainsaw-OCR is an in-progress application with the goal to allow users to download images from the MangaDex API, scan them for text, store the results and perform searches for phrases within said results. It is a personal project of mine that serves as a passtime as well as a chance for me to practice my developing Python knowledge.

### Why Make This?
For the past 3 years I have been a massive fan of the ongoing manga series Chainsaw Man. About 2 months ago, while scrolling through the series' dedicated subreddit, I came across a fan theory that sparked my interest, but for it to hold any credit, I would need to look through for the mention of a certain phrase. Now I imagine you may have noticed the language I'm using is very cryptic, and that is for two reasons:

1. It would take much longer than your time is worth for me to explain in detail the theory and the reasoning behind the chosen phrase in question.
2. All in all it doesn't make much difference to the purpose of the app, aside from it's current working name, "Chainsaw-OCR".

Because of these two reasons, I will be including the link to the theory below, however as i mentioned I first saw this months ago and at this time am unable to find it, but I'll make sure to update this once I do!
