Title: Chainsaw-OCR
Description: An app that searches the MangaDex API for a manga series,
returns the results in chosen language, and stores the chapter information in a
database. The app will then use chapter info from database to retrieve url data
for chapter pages for downloading. These links will be stored in another table
in the same database as the images are downloaded to a location of the user's
choice. From there the app will scan through selected chapters for text and
store results to a text file corresponding to the chapter.
